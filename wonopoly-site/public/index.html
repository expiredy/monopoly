      content="Web site created using create-react-app, for my owm real cool web game.
               In the game, players roll two dice to move around the game board,
               buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels.
               Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy.
               Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares.
               Players receive a stipend every time they pass 'Go', and can end up in jail,
               from which they cannot move until they have met one of three conditions.
               The game has numerous house rules, and hundreds of different editions exist,
               as well as many spin-offs and related media. "
